                Dear Divya,<br><br>
                These past three months have been the most incredible journey of my life. Every moment with you is a
                treasure,
                and I cherish all the facets of your being.
                I love your cute face that brightens my day, your childish behavior that brings joy and laughter, and
                even your
                anger which shows how passionate you are.
                I admire your good sides and embrace your bad sides, because they all make you uniquely you.<br><br>
                You are my everything, and I promise to always be by your side. Through the highs and the lows, I will
                never
                leave you. My love for you grows stronger each day,
                and I look forward to every moment we will share together.<br><br>
                With all my love,<br>
                [Your Kamli]
